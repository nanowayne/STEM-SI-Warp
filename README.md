# STEM-SI-Warper

A software tool to correct image distortions of atomically resolved spectrum images and 4D-STEM. It was written in Digital Micrograph (DM, Gatan Inc) scripting language as a DM plugin. Two typical distortions can be corrected, i.e. linear and nonlinear distortions. The multidimensional warp and offset functions are installed as libraries and can be called externally (see the example script).

The reference and technical notes of this plugin: Y. Wang et al, Correcting the linear and nonlinear distortions for atomically resolved STEM spectrum and diffraction imaging, Microscopy, 67, i114(2018).
