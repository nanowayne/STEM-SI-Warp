# STEM-SI-Warper

A software tool for post-correcting the linear and nonlinear image distortions of atomically resolved 3D spectrum imaging as well as 4D diffraction imaging. It was written in Digital Micrograph (DM, Gatan Inc) scripting language as a DM plugin. The multidimensional warp and offset functions can be called externally(see the example script).

The reference and technical notes of this plugin: Y. Wang et al, Correcting the linear and nonlinear distortions for atomically resolved STEM spectrum and diffraction imaging, Microscopy, 67, i114(2018).
